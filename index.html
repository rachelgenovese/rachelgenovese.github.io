<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>Rachel Genovese</h2>
<p> Graduating in the spring of 2015 from the University of Florida, I plan to someday work the streets of Hollywood filming and writing for the lastest and greatest cult sitcom. Besides my love of raunchy comedy, cheesy pop-culture references, and all things a cappella music, I balance my time with family, friends and the neighbors animals who I treat as my own. I hope to one day "make it big" but not before paying my dues <img src="ShowcaseScavengerHuntExampleDOC.jpg" </p>
